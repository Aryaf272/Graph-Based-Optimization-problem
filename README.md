# Graph-Based-Optimization-Problem

This project addresses a graph-based optimization problem focused on partitioning a set of nodes into disjoint clusters. 
The goal is to improve internal connectivity within each cluster while respecting predefined node weight capacity constraints.
The solution uses genetic algorithms and hill climbing to optimize the partitioning, with performance evaluated based on the total edge weight within clusters.
